# CSU Appointments

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## An Easier way for Chicago State Students to make appointment with their tutors.

Having difficulties making appointment with tutors can delay/deter students from reaching out and getting the help they need. I worked as one, and know how frustrating it can be to miss students just because of appointment issues. Knowing I went through this problem, I decided to do something about it. 
To make it easier to manage, I integrated Google Script as a way for the students and administrators to add necessary data that then gets sent to mongoDB. I believe this approach makes it secure while also ensuring ease of use for all users.
